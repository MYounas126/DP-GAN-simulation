# Automated Drone Flight Setup using Unity

This project demonstrates how to import a drone from the Unity Asset Store, configure the `DroneController` script, and use it to generate data for simulating and automating drone flight. This setup is ideal for testing autonomous drone behaviors, generating flight control data, and leveraging the Unity environment for simulation purposes.

## Overview

In this guide, we'll:
1. Import a drone model from the Unity Asset Store.
2. Attach and configure the `DroneController` script to control the drone.
3. Set up automated flight and generate control data (e.g., throttle, pitch, yaw, etc.) that can be used for training or simulation.

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.x or higher.
- Access to the **Unity Asset Store**.
- Basic knowledge of Unity and C# scripting.
